{"data":{"elApi":{"allGuideText":[{"who":"We created this field guide for practitioners looking to integrate more equitable and inclusive practices into their media literacy educational work. \n\n### Is this guide only for teachers?\nThe guide is for everyone! But we designed it with “practitioners” in mind, meaning anyone working in media literacy. \n \n### Can I use this guide if I’m not teaching media literacy?\nYes! We designed the field guide to help you evaluate your stance and provide guidance for implementing more equitable and inclusive practices.\n \n### Can I assign this guide to students/partners?\nYou could, but it’s not designed as a lesson plan. Instead, the guide provides questions to help you evaluate your work and give some suggestions.  \n \n### Will the guide provide a curriculum or lesson plan?\nNo. The field guide was not designed as a lesson plan or to provide a suggested curriculum. It was created to provide a space for self-evaluation and guidance on key concepts.\n"}]}}}
