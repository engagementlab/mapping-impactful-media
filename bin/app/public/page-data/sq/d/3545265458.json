In other words, we must ask: **What’s my standpoint?** \n\n**“Standpoint”** is a concept developed to help us understand how our perspectives and ideas about the world are shaped by our lived experiences. What we know and don’t know is not based on the knowledge we acquire from school or books alone. Rather, it is informed by our personal identities, social identities, and life choices based on the resources and circumstances within which we live. \n\nOur personal narratives matter.

Where do I stand?**\n\nWhether interrogating news content, advertisements, or producing a short film, it’s important to consider our own position in relation to this media. To do this, ask the learners to complete a short reflection on their standpoint as they enter into a media literacy experience. \n\nFor example, here’s a prompt to help onboard all learners to standpoint theory in media literacy. \n\n*Prompt*: Who we are today is largely based on where we come from, our experiences as we grow in life, the events that shape us, and the relationships we build, keep, and change. These collectively make up our standpoint. For this exercise, take some paper, and markers, and write down what people, experiences, places, environments, and resources shape who you are and how you see the world. Be as creative and open as you can, (writing, drawing, speaking), to consider: What is your standpoint, and what resources (people, places, things) have helped inform this position? \n\nBe open, and honest!","atStake":"### 2. What's at stake?\n\nOur standpoint is not only influenced by our experiences in lived environments, it's also informed and influenced by the media habits we keep. The media we engage with offer representations about the world, which we constantly negotiate.  In considering our Standpoint, we must ask how media informs our beliefs and worldviews, and what’s at stake in these messages, for us and those around us.\n\nIn this exploration, build on your standpoint exercise, but this time, think about the media messages we encounter. Think about a media outlet, platform, network, show, film, etc. that you engage with. Take that piece of media, and answer the questions in our “what’s at stake” table.\n\nUse the questions in the table to the right as your guide. Start with the top half and then move to the bottom. As you progress through the quadrants, take notes. How do your thoughts develop? Do they come in conflict with your personal beliefs and values or reaffirm them?\n\n","story":"### 3. Why does this matter?\n\nThe final exploration in our “Where do I stand” Stop is to consider how our standpoint and our media habits influence how we see the world and understand our place in it. \n\nBased on your own standpoint, and the media representations that you explored, \nengage in a think/pair/share exercise where you reflect on the questions below, pair together to talk about your reflection, and share out with our larger community. \n\n* How do media impact how I see the world?\n* How do media impact my relationships?\n* How does my standpoint impact my media habits?\n* How do my media choices influence my attitudes and behaviors?\n* Why does this matter?
