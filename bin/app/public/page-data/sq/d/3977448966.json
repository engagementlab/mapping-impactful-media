{"data":{"elApi":{"allMimHomePages":[{"intro":"While calls for media literacy practices to better support an equitable society are increasing within the field (and society at large), there remains a gap between how impactful media literacy practices are defined and how they are connected to equitable goals supporting just and inclusive futures.\n\nThe *Mapping Impactful Media Literacy Project* explores how impact and equity are understood and applied in media literacy practice and research.","about":"We believe that media literacies are central to a society that demands accountability from public institutions, equity for marginalized and underserved communities, and robust opportunities for people to use their voices to advocate for more inclusive futures. This project will research how we have defined impact in media literacy and advocate for indicators that support the needs of communities and youth at the margins of society. \n\nRead more about our work, meet our team, access the full findings of our research, use our field guide for equitable media literacy practice and be in touch with any further questions or become involved in our work.","facebook":"Initial support for the research project is made possible through the National Association for Media Literacy Education and Facebook.
