Imagination allows us to depart, momentarily, from the realities that are sometimes too difficult or dire to confront with energy, passion, and joy. We can use our imagination to project ideal futures that are more inclusive and equitable. We use imagination to circumvent the boundaries from which our present struggles are constrained. Media scholar Henry Jenkins writes about the potential of imagination: *“one cannot change the world unless one can imagine what a better world might look like.”*","imagination":"To truly aspire to a more inclusive future, we must use imagination to envision and enact the types of media environments that will support and nourish equitable and just civic and media possibilities. **Imagination** allows us to do the following: \n\n*Get outside of the box, burn it if we have to, and make something of the ashes that’s new, different, and vital.\n\n*Explore alternative forms of expression, engagement, and participation both within and beyond the platforms we spend so much time with.\n\n*Find alternative forms of engagement, whether to simply circumvent norms for communication or to experiment with radically new or different media spaces.\n\n*Move people beyond the limitations they often perceive or experience within the constraints of daily information and communication routines. \n\n**Imagination** is a way to forge connection, spark creativity, and pursue more inclusive media.To truly aspire to a more just future, we must use imagination to envision and enact the types of media environments that will support and nourish equitable civic and media possibilities.\n\n**Questions to Consider For Imagination-Based Media Literacy Practice**\n\nHow can we imagine alternatives to current media? \n\nWhat ways can imagination help bring more voices into our media environments? \n\nHow can imagination help us build more inclusive futures? \n\n","exercise":"### Exploring Imagination: Three Approaches\n\nOne of the first ways to understand alternatives to our present media ecosystems is to envision alternatives to how we consume, share, create and engage with media. \n\nFor this exercise, choose an issue/topic to discuss with your students/community. It could be politics, the environment, health, the economy, or something about media systems. Then, in the T-chart below, list all the ways in which you learn about this issue on one side. On the other hand, imagine other ways, spaces, processes, systems that can replace or complement the existing structures listed on the left.Be as creative and open as possible. Nothing is off limits!\n\nAfter generating the list, discuss how these approaches are similar or different, and what impact they have on our media systems and world.","alternatives":"### 1. Imagining Alternatives To The Current Situation","where1Blurb":"Examples can include different types of media. ","where2Blurb":"Use your imagination to brainstorm new ways to share information. \n\n**Remember to be as creative as you can. Imagine and Experiment!**","voice":"### 2. Imagining (More & Different) Voices \n\nImagining alternatives is not only about different media systems and structures. It’s also about different voices represented in media. Building on the previous prompt, imagine models, scenarios, and rules for more inclusive and equitable voices in our media ecosystems. \n","voicePrompt":"Use the following directions as a guide: \n\n\n*Create a set of guidelines/rules to ensure that media are more inclusive.*\n\n\n *Consider how we can ensure that media sources are more diverse.* \n\n\n*Imagine ways to use media to connect people in inclusive and supportive ways.*\n\n**Remember. Use your imagination to be as creative as possible!** ","practicing":"Imagining more inclusive media environments is not only a problem of the present but also of the future. In our third activity, we are asking learners to imagine dynamic media futures through the following world-building scenario.","practicingPrompt":"*Scenario:* The Year is 2060, and you’re tasked with designing a media ecosystem for a more inclusive future. You can draw, write or record your future media scenario. Consider: what the world is like? What norms will be part of the world, how will the media exist? What will be the platforms? Spaces? Connections? Modes of expression? Think big and wide. It’s 2060 so anything is on the table! \n\nPresent your vision as creatively as possible. Perform it. Narrate it. Draw it. Dance it! \n\nAfter presentations, reflect on which elements here can seed interesting \ninnovations for stronger and more inclusive media futures.","learningGuide":"### Using Imagination in Your Media Literacy Learning Environment [Template]\n\n**IT'S YOUR TURN!** \n\nUsing the template here, create your own media literacy learning experiences around the following learning goals:  \n\nHow can we use imagination-based approaches  to help learners move beyond the current realities of our digital cultures? \nHow can we use imagination-based approaches to help learners develop the mindsets to creatively explore more inclusive media environments? \nHow can we build more imaginative media literacy learning environments through an emphasis on creativity, experimentation and blue sky thinking?\n\n\n**Template for Your Imagination Workshop**\n\n**Time Needed:**\n\n**Materials Needed:** \n\nPart One: Introducing Imagination Exercise \n\nPart Two: Core Activities [use from above or create your own!]\n\nPart Three: Debrief [what questions do you want your learners to reflect on after this experience]\n\nPart Four: Educator Reflection\n"}]}}}
