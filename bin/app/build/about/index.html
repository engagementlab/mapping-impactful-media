This research has taken place across academic disciplines and within a variety of formal and informal education settings. As a result, there exists no widely accepted framework for defining and measuring impactful media literacy practice.</p><p>This project seeks to build a common framework for identifying and measuring impactful media literacy practices in the United States. The values that guide our project are as follows:</p><ul><li>Media literacy practices prioritize marginalized and underserved communities
            </li><li>Media literacy practices prioritize just and equitable futures
            </li><li>Media literacy practices are guided by caring ethics.
            </li><li>Media literacy practices encourage experimentation, risk-taking, play, and failure.
            </li><li>Media literacy practices are nourishing, supportive, inclusive, and respectful.

<p>Despite the increasing research into media literacy interventions across primary and secondary education in the United States, there has been little consensus on what makes interventions impactful, and how that impact should be measured.</p>
<p>We will conduct a systematic literature review of media literacy interventions in the United States, to identify and highlight what the research counts as an impactful media literacy practice. A systematic literature review will allow us to provide, for the first time in the United States, a comprehensive inquiry into two decades of research exploring the evaluation of media literacy education.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of the systematic literature review, we will identify a core set of indicators for impactful media literacy outcomes. These indicators will inform phase two of our research.</p>
