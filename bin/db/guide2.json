We care about fairness, justice, and equity. We care about our environment, our possessions, and our health. In short, we have a lot to care about.\n\nMedia helps reinforce all the ways we care—from supporting causes to donating resources to initiatives that we want to succeed. \n\nWe signal caring through media as well: liking, retweeting, posting, sharing, and affiliating with groups and organizations. We also care by donating time, resources, and energy to help others.\n\n**So, how is care a part of our media literacy experiences? And what role can caring have in building more equitable media literacy practices?** \n\nScholar Joan Tronto defines several forms of \"caring.\"\n\n**Caring about** - transactional, signals affiliation \n\n**Caring for** - relational, ways we act towards others/things \n\n**Caring with** - practices consistent with democratic commitments\n\nCare is a core component of all media literacy practices, from why we care about messages to how we care for them. \n\nHow we build a culture of care in media literacy practices can greatly impact how we see media messages work in the world and how we develop relationships with others in learning and community settings. ","caring":"### 1. Caring About v. Caring For\n\nIn media literacy learning experiences, we ask ourselves to continuously reflect on how media represent issues we care about and how we can use media to care about and care for those issues. In this prompt, we ask learners to differentiate between **caring about** and **caring for** our actions using media. Ask learners to make a t-chart like the one below and answer the following questions, either in general or on a specific issue (environment, health, education, etc.)","caringBlurb":"How do we signal our support for or against issues through the media? For example, this could be tweeting, liking, signing petitions, etc.\n\nWhat is valuable about this type of care? \n\nWhat are the potential problems with these types of actions?","caringForBlurb":"How can we use media to build meaningful relationships with the issues we **care about**?\n\nWhat time, energy, and resources would we need to devote to support an issue? How might that support reflect **caring for** through media?\n\n What are the potential benefits and risks of **caring for** an issue? ","caringWith":"### 2. Caring with others\n\nOnce we differentiate **caring about** from **caring for**, we are then able to align how we care with “democratic commitments to justice, equality, and freedom for all.” - Joan Tronto. ","caringWithPrompt":"### Prompt: statement on caring with\n\nCaring with others means we must both signal (care about) and act (care for).  Look at both sides of your t-chart. Based on what you included, how can you care with others in mind?\n\nIn a short reflection (using whatever method you choose), share how you care with others.\n\nThen, think about how caring with others can be applied to media representation. If our goal is “democratic commitments to justice, equality, and freedom for all,” then we need to share how we think that is possible. **In one sentence or image, let us know how this is possible. How should media care with others?**","careful":"### 3. Care(ful) Statements\n\nClearly delineating how we care about, for, and with can help us better see how we can use media to support the ideas and issues we value. This last prompt is about keeping “care” at the center of our media literacy work. ","carefulPrompt":"### Prompt: caring ladder \n\nBuild a ladder of care, to show how you can use media to care about, care for, and care with issues that matter. \n\nStart with the bottom of the ladder. What should your first step be? **Think about how on a real ladder, the first rung is the most important.** Without that foundation, one cannot climb any higher.  In a sense, without a foundation, it would be impossible to achieve your ultimate goal of achieving \"justice, equality, and freedom for all.\"\n\nAs you climb the ladder, building more rungs, think about how each step you chose builds to the next. And with each step, we should be getting closer to using media to support equity, inclusion, and justice for all. \n\nOnce you reach the top, what did you accomplish? \nWhat did your ladder reach? \nWhy does this end goal matter to you? \nWhy should others see this end as important? \n\nLastly, **reflect**: how did you move from caring about and for to caring with others? How do you think media can be used to achieve just and equitable realities.\n","__v":0}
