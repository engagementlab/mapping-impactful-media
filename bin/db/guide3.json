{"_id":{"$oid":"610c13d9270e571cf22b79dd"},"name":"Imagining (More) Inclusive Futures","intro":"**Imagination is what compels us to think differently.** It takes us beyond the current constraints we may face in our communities, in politics, in society, and in the world. \n\nImagination is a spark. It allows us to depart, momentarily, from the realities that are sometimes too difficult or dire to confront with energy, passion, and joy. We can use our imagination to project ideal futures that are more inclusive and equitable. We use imagination to circumvent the boundaries from which our present struggles are constrained. Media scholar Henry Jenkins writes about the potential of imagination: “*one cannot change the world unless one can imagine what a better world might look like*.”\n\nTo truly aspire to a more inclusive future, we must use imagination to envision and enact the types of media environments that will support and nourish equitable and just civic and media possibilities. ","imagination":"**Imagination** allows us to do the following: \n\n*Get outside of the box, burn it if we have to, and make something of the ashes that’s new, different, and vital.\n\n*Strengthen our minds and stretch our thinking to create something from nothing. Explore alternative forms of expression, engagement, and participation both within and beyond the platforms we spend so much time with.\n\n*Find alternative forms of engagement, whether to simply circumvent norms for communication or to experiment with radically new or different media spaces.\n\n*Move people beyond the limitations they often perceive or experience within the constraints of daily information and communication routines. \n","exercise":"For this activity, grab a piece of paper, some writing utensils, and choose an issue you’re discussing with your students or community. It could be about politics, the environment, health, the economy, or media. \n\nOn your paper, make a T-chart: list how you learn about this issue on one side. This could be where you learn about the issue, from who, and how? On the other side, have students brainstorm alternative spaces, processes, information realities that they could imagine to replace or complement the existing structures. \n\n**Be as creative and open as possible.**","alternatives":"### a. Imagining Alternatives To The Current Situation\n\nOne of the first ways to understand alternatives to our present media ecosystems is to imagine alternatives for how we consume, share, create, and engage with media. ","voice":"### b. Voice, representation, & connection\n\nImagining alternatives is not just about different media systems and structures. It is about the different voices that we see represented in our media ecosystems. \n\nFor this prompt, imagine models, scenarios, and rules for more inclusive and equitable voices in our media ecosystems. ","voicePrompt":"Build on the previous prompt by answering the following questions:\n\n1. What are some guidelines/rules to ensure that our media ecosystems are more inclusive? \n2. How can we ensure that our media sources are more diverse? \n3. How can we use media to connect various ideas in vibrant ways? \n\nThis can take the form of a chart or a numbered or bulleted list.","practicing":"Imagining more inclusive media environments is not only a problem of the present but also of the future. In this prompt, learners have the opportunity to build more inclusive futures by engaging in a world-building scenario. ","practicingPrompt":"Imagine 40 years in the future! You are tasked with designing a media ecosystem for that future. Draw, write or record your vision. \n\n**You must consider:**\nWhat will the world be like? \nWhat norms will be part of the world?\nHow will media exist? \nWhat will be the platforms?\nWhat will be the modes of expression?\n\nThink big and wide. This can be about media and an issue (40 years in the future) or about media more generally! ","__v":0,"where1Blurb":"Examples can include different types of media. ","where2Blurb":"Use your imagination to brainstorm new ways to share information. \n\n**Remember to be as creative as you can. Imagine and Experiment!**"}
