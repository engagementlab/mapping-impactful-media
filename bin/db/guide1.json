As we enter into media literacy experiences, we should ask **what is at stake** in these messages, for us and those around us. \n\nUse the questions in the table as your guide. As you progress through the quadrants, take notes. How do your thoughts develop? Do they come in conflict with your personal beliefs and values or reaffirm them?

Where do I stand / What resources do I have?\n\nWhether interrogating news content, deconstructing advertisements, or producing a short film, it’s important to consider our own position to this media. To do this, ask your learners to complete a short reflection on their standpoint as they enter into a media literacy experience.\n\n### Questions To Consider:\n* What is my standpoint? Think through the different interpretations of **\"standpoint\"** listed above. How does each affect you?\n* Think about the community you work in. Do you understand their standpoint? Are there questions you can ask to understand their standpoint more? \n* How can your students better understand their media choices through standpoint? \n","resourcesPrompt":"**Who you are is a product of the experiences, events, and relationships you’ve had throughout life.** \n\nThink about those things and reflect:\n* What do you believe in? \n* Why do you believe in it? \n* What do you have that others do not? Why is that? \n* What challenges you the most, and what helps you through that challenge? \n\nIn a short reflection (written, artistic, spoken--whatever feels the most appropriate), share your responses to those questions.","standpoint":"**Standpoint** acknowledges the following:\n* A physical space \n* A mental place \n* A worldview \n* A set of principles  \n\nEquity-driven media literacy practices should start with self-reflection by asking: **Where Do I Stand?**\n\nWhat each individual brings into a media literacy learning environment shaped how they engage with media, with co-learners, and with the information and ideas around them.","story":"### 3.
