Frequently individuals are elevated through media as catalysts for change (see Greta Thunberg). While individual narratives matter, we believe that it’s the collective power of the community that’s most important for media literacy practices to thrive.\n\nIn this guide, we’ve moved from thinking about our personal relationship to media, how we care for others with media, how to use media to imagine better futures, and how to think about community connections with media. \n\nIn this final portion of the guide, we ask **“where do we stand”** in support of the collective capacities and connections needed to engage in the civic work of media literacy. \n\nHarry Boyte, who focuses his work on civic agency and public engagement in democracy, writes that we need to reinvigorate civic education and engagement norms for our students: \n\n\"We live in a hyper-regulated world that constrains agency on every side, a world of hidden manipulations, standardized programs, mass mobilizations, and bureaucratic interventions. In a memorable turn of phrase, the South African writer Xolela Mangcu has termed the invisible virus spreading through modern societies that erodes agency **' technocratic creep.'** Given this erosion, it is no wonder that our students feel powerless about changing institutions that seem to have a life of their own, even if institutional pathologies insult their basic values and standards.\"","introSection2":"How can media literacy push back against the technocratic creep that Boyte references? We believe that equitable media literacy practices must embrace the collective capacity of people to act together towards more equitable and just futures. \n\nThis means learning to leverage media to be with others in concerted and connected efforts for positive change in the world. This isn’t a perfect science, but it’s vital to media literacy’s connection to stronger democracy and civil society norms.","questions":"### Questions to Consider:\t\n\n\nIn what ways have you used media to support or lift up a community? This can include using hashtags, memes, or creating a virtual meeting space through platforms such as Discord or Facebook.\n\n\nCan you think of an example of **“technocratic creep”** that is specific to your community or the community you wish to serve?\n\n\nHow can we use media to not only highlight a problem but imagine creative solutions?\n\n\nConsider the specific ways in which your communities use media. For example, what kinds of media technologies are most prevalent? What language, symbols and social platforms are most used to express opinions and ideas?\n\n","enabling":"### A. Enabling Environments\n\nHarry Boyte writes that we need collective agency to cultivate enabling environments where people can come together, across differences, to work together to act on common challenges. From public health and environmental justice to economic inequalities and racial oppression, these are issues that we can approach, with and through media, in local, national, and global contexts.\n\n**For this activity, sketch out what types of media skills are needed to build “enabling media environments” for collective public action.**\n\nThink about both individual and collective skills; by this, we mean think not only about what individuals might use but ways communities use media. The skills you come up with could be in the context of media use or ways to meaningfully identify problems, engage with others, and build spaces for open dialog across differences. \n\nConsider ways to connect these skills to collective action. For example, how can you work with these skills to create an “enabling media environment” to address problems in your community?   ","capacity":"### B. The Capacity To Act\n\nPublic action taking is not only about how to take action, but who to take action with and in what ways. Media are conduits within which we can connect, act, and be together. \n\t\nBuilding on the enabling media environments activity, create user personas of the types of media literate action takers in the world, focusing on what resources they have, what capacities they have, and what skills they have.  \n\nUser personas are a bio for a fictional character representing an individual who interact with your message. \n\nCreate two to three personas to help form a super team of media-literate civic actors! Don’t be afraid to get creative with your personas. Consider these questions:\n\n**Who is your target audience?**\n\n**What might their average day look like?**\n\n**Where do they encounter media messages most?**","margins":"### C. From The Margins To The Middle\n\nLastly, examine who is missing from your community pictures. Even with the best intentions, we can leave individuals out who have challenges or identities we don’t often think about when we imagine our own community.  \n\nTake a moment to look over the previous activities: your sketch of skills and your civic actor personas.  \n\n**Who do you see when you think of a skilled media user?** \n\n**Did you think of everyone in your community?**  ","marginsPrompt":"For this activity, you will create a mood board. To do this, you will need to gather images, words, and ideas related to your community. Mood boards can help you visualize an idea and make connections across community spaces before organizing others. \n\nAs you create your board, think of everyone in your community. Include the things many people have in common, but also some key differences. If it helps, begin to draw lines, use string to make connections, or develop other ways to visualize connections between individuals in your community. \n\nOnce you’ve created your mood board, revisit it with the other activities in mind. Begin to make connections across the different parts of your community. \n\nHow can you bring in more voices? \nHow can you include everyone you hope to reach? \nHow are some still possibly being left out?\n\n**MODIFICATION: This activity also works well for groups. Bring a group together to create a mood board. What kind of connections can be made when several people are using the board to develop a picture of the community?**","__v":0}
