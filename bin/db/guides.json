The guide emerges from our research into how media literacy interventions can prioritize more equitable and just civic futures with intentionality, care, and purpose. \n\nWe urge you to use this guide to explore how you can make your media literacy educational practices inclusive and equity-focused. ","startText3":"[Our team](/team) has researched how media literacy practitioners understand and prioritize equity in their media literacy practice. We are interested in what impact means as a process and as an aspirational goal for media literacy interventions. Based on this work, we created a Field Guide for Equitable Media Literacy Practice that is available for public use. ","startTextIntentions":"> **Who?** This guide is for practitioners interested in designing equity-focused media literacy practices. \n> **What?** This guide offers five priority areas to consider when building equity-focused media literacy practices.\n> **How?** This guide provides activities, questions to consider, and guidance for reflection on equitable media literacy practices.\n> **Why?** This guide reinforces equity, inclusion, and care in media literacy practices that aspire to support more inclusive futures. ","who":"We created this field guide for practitioners looking to integrate more equitable and inclusive practices into their media literacy educational work. \n\n### Is this guide only for teachers?\nThe guide is for everyone! But we designed it with “practitioners” in mind, meaning anyone working in media literacy. \n \n### Can I use this guide if I’m not teaching media literacy?\nYes! We designed the field guide to help you evaluate your stance and provide guidance for implementing more equitable and inclusive practices.\n \n### Can I assign this guide to students/partners?\nYou could, but it’s not designed as a lesson plan. Instead, the guide provides questions to help you evaluate your work and give some suggestions.  \n \n### Will the guide provide a curriculum or lesson plan?\nNo. The field guide was not designed as a lesson plan or to provide a suggested curriculum. It was created to provide a space for self-evaluation and guidance on key concepts.\n","howTo1":"If you wish to follow a linear progression through the guide we suggest starting with the first section, called [\"Where Do I Stand?\"](/guide/where-do-i-stand). Each section ends with suggestions to move you to the next stop. ","howTo2":"If you like to play by your own rules, you can click any point on the [map](/guide/map) to explore. At the end of each section, there are suggestions for the next stop on your tour, but you don’t have to follow those directions. ","process1":"In this field guide, you will notice we refer to processes a lot. This is because our research revealed a focus on outcomes as an impactful measure of media literacy practice. In contrast, media literacy processes point to how we educate and build community. \n\nWe understand process as how learning happens and outcomes as the product of a learning experience. The emphasis on outcomes is natural as many programs depend on hard numbers or measured achievements for funding or proof of concept. However, we mustn't lose sight of the value process has in impacting an individual, community, or society.  \n\nWe’ve created this guide to emphasize the process toward any outcome. For example, suppose you are developing a curriculum that must meet learning standards or targets. In that case, this guide will help you process that curriculum in a way that positions equity at the forefront. Likewise, if you are responsible for answering to funders, then this guide provides a way to think about how to share your results in a way that shows socially just work as a priority. \n","process2":"However you choose to progress through the guide, we hope this work will help you consider both equitable outcomes and the processes that can leave a lasting impact. ","standing":"While we hope that what we are offering in this guide sparks new approaches to media literacy practices in formal and informal learning spaces, we have built on the work of so many who have come before us. As the common saying goes, this project “**stands on the shoulders of media literacy’s giants**.” \n\nIn conducting our research and creating this guide, we have visited and revisited research, curricula, reports, and a range of other content exploring media literacy interventions within the United States and beyond. \n\nOur work adds to the breadth and scope of media literacy, too many to mention here. This project embraces and incorporates various working assumptions and principles that have guided research, practice, and pedagogy. \n\nWe have not attempted to separate or parse out definitions or “sub-literacies” but hope that our focus on equity, and the values that guide this work, can be adapted for use across domains. We also hope this approach can speak to much of the work we have built upon.\n\n**We stand in solidarity with media literacy practitioners, scholars, activists, and educators who support equity, inclusion, and prioritizing media literacy for those at the margins of society.** \n","whatElse":"This field guide is an interactive tool, not a lesson plan or curriculum. \n\nOur design aims to help practitioners contemplate equity-driven and inclusive media literacy practices. It is open and free to use. \n\nIt was built from extensive [research](http://qa.mappingimpactfulml.org/report) conducted in 2020-2021.\n\nThe report and field guide provide guidance for finding answers to tough questions about equity and inclusion in media literacy. We aim to push the conversation forward and create a better future for the coming generations. \n\nWe encourage you to explore the entire field guide and take advantage of the exercises, evaluations, and activities across the five sections. \n\nIf you have questions about the field guide or the research behind it, please contact us. \n"}
