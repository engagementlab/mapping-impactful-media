These shared norms allow communitiies to be present with one another across different ideas, preferences, or backgrounds. Communities exist all around us, including the neighborhoods, schools, churches, libraries, sports teams, and other organizations we observe daily.\n\nCommunities today do not depend on physical spaces alone. Today, online communities are as or more common in our lives than physical ones. In online spaces, a different set of social norms guides our engagement with others. \n\nMedia scholar danah boyd writes that networked communities offer the affordances of connectivity, durability, and spreadability. However, they can also be invasive and lack the human presence necessary to build trust and care. In networked communities, we rely on the digitally constructed identities of our peers as they exist online.","introSection2":"How we use media to be engaged in communities can define the health and strength of the community spaces we inhabit. Whether an online community forum or a group working on environmental health, media facilitate norms for dialog, trust and care amongst community members. So how can media be used to build stronger, better, and more connected communities? ","__v":0,"communities":"### a. Learning About Communities\n\nA lot of times in media literacy education, we look at communities through media. We distance ourselves from communities to explore through how they are portrayed and how they interact. Often times, we forgo the necessary work of understanding how and why communities exist in the first place. \n\nFor this portion of the field guide, select a community. For example, it could be an online advocacy group, a local neighborhood group, or an after-school organization. Find something that you or your students are familiar with or can learn about.\n\nAfter selecting that community, create a map about that community. Include the community's local media, public spaces, resources, and other interesting information, like population, diversity, age, and so on. Make the map vibrant and lively.\n\n**Draw or construct a community map that represents the community as a vibrant group!**","media":"### b. Media And Communities\n\nIdentities are often layered. The individuals we reach in our practice will often find themselves within several communities – some based on physical location and others based on cultural or social identity. Once you have a map of the community you’ve chosen to represent, consider the following:","mediaPrompt1":"### Media representation\n\n* How is the community represented by the media? Or is it represented at all? \n* How might the community represent itself in the media?\n* How are community members' identities present, if at all?\n* How do media representations uphold or challenge stereotypes about the community?","mediaPrompt2":"### Media Use\n\nHow do individuals in your community use media?\n\nConsider everything from the technology to the language/communication norms:\n* Do individuals use those technologies differently based on the community they are in?\n* Does the language of the individuals change when they move to a different community?\n* Why might these changes be important?","questions":"### Questions to Consider:\n\n*How often do you engage in community outreach? Do you seek voices/perspectives outside of your organization?* \n*How often do you seek feedback from your community? In what ways do you seek feedback from your community?*\n*Do your goals align with the community you serve, or are they modeled to fit a different community/outcome?* \n","withNotFor":"\n### c. With (and not for) Communities\n\nIt is important to center the voices of the community you wish to engage in your media literacy practice. Being an active listener is difficult but important. Creating a collaborative environment means building a media literacy practice **with your community and not for the community. \n\nWhat do we mean by with (and not for)? It is a way of reframing our thinking as practitioners from a preset standard of outcomes we wish to meet to a more process-based way of building relationships within a community. It also lessons the distance between us and the communities that we are part of or exploring.\n \nNow that you have your community map and some ideas about the media representation and uses of the community, it is time to take the next steps and **listen to the community**.","withNotForPrompt":"### Hearing Diverse Voices\n\nUp to this point, much of what you’ve been asked to do is critically think. What we need to do now is begin to act.\n\nThink about members of your community who are changemakers. Start by making a list of people you know but not well enough in your community. These are the people you want to learn more about.\n\nWhen you have that list, who are two people you want to know more about? Use these questions to guide your thinking:\n*Why would you want to learn more about them?\n*How are they similar to you?\n*How are they different from you?\n*How would you go about contacting them?\n*What would you want to ask them?\n*What could you talk about related to media?"}
