How can impactful media literacy practices support more just, equitable, and inclusive futures?  \n\nThe *Mapping Impactful Media Literacy Project* explores how impact in media literacy interventions is understood, develops indicators for impactful practice, and offers education across formal and informal learning ecosystems the opportunity to align their work within a responsive guide that facilitates alignment with indicators for impact.&quot;,&quot;about&quot;:&quot;We believe that media literacies are central to a society that demands accountability from public institutions, equity for marginalized and underserved communities, and robust opportunities for people to use their voice to advocate for more inclusive futures. This project will research how we have defined impact in media literacy, and advocate for indicators that support the needs of communities and youth at the margins of society. \n\nThe project will run in three phases from **June 2020 - August 2021**.\n\nRead more about our process at our Project Page, meet our team, hear from our contributors, and be in touch with any further questions or to become involved in our work.&quot;,&quot;facebook&quot;:&quot;Initial support for the research project is made possible through a grant\n    from Facebook. To ensure the independence and integrity of this research\n    effort, NAMLE will maintain full authority regarding project strategy,\n    budget, personnel decisions, or research activities. Facebook will not have\n    direct control over the research design, methodology, analysis, or findings.\n    NAMLE and any research authors will maintain exclusive copyright over all\n    products and freely disseminate those products to advance the media literacy\n    field.&quot;,&quot;partners&quot;:&quot;Research like this would not be possible without the support of institutions, universities, and private investors who have an interest in improving media literacy education. We are grateful for their assistance and want to highlight a few of the institutions responsible for this opportunity.&quot;}],&quot;allMimPeople&quot;:[{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Paul Mihailidis&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Co-Principal Investigator&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Paul is an associate professor and graduate program director for the Media Design program at Emerson College.
